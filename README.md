UFO Dataset

Level 1: Automatic Table and Data Search

In this challenge, the starter code provided was used to customize the HTML web page. JavaScript code was written using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects to append a table to the web page and add rows of data for each sighting. 

A date form was created in the HTML doc while the code listened for events and filtered through the date column to match user input.
